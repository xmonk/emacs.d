# Emacs Configuration.

I use emacs trunk for my daily tasks, I update it often, so my configuration
might not work with earlier version of Emacs.

## Installation

If you already have .emacs.d directory do:

	mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.my.emacs.d

then:

	git clone https://github.com/xmonk/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
